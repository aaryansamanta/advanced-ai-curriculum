# Aaryan Samanta – Advanced AI Capstone Projects + AI & Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing Capstone work from the following courses. The work housed here represents **original research and applied projects** and is intentionally maintained separately from public coursework to protect academic integrity, sensitive data usage, and future publication opportunities. This repository also demonstrates my learning in **Python programming, data analysis, visualization, supervised learning, NLP, and neural networks**.


- 🧠 AI & Technology Honors
- 📊 Data Science Honors
- 🤖 AI Internship Honors

## 🧠 Capstone Projects Overview

This repository includes **two major capstone projects**, each aligned with a different advanced program and designed to reflect real-world problem solving using AI and data science.

## 🤖 AI Internship Capstone  
**Medical Imaging & Deep Learning**

### 🎯 Objective
Develop a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect signs of **pneumonia in chest X-ray images** using a labeled medical imaging dataset.

This project focuses on applying deep learning techniques to a real-world healthcare problem by:

- Preprocessing and analyzing medical image data  
- Designing and training CNN architectures  
- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics  
- Conducting experiments and iterative improvements  
- Producing a detailed technical report documenting methodology, results, and insights  

> ⚠️ Due to the use of medical imaging data and the research-oriented nature of the work, this project is kept seperate

## 📊 Data Science Capstone  
**Disease Symptom & Patient Profile Analysis**

### 🎯 Objective
Investigate a real-world healthcare question by **exploring disease symptoms and patient profiles** through structured data analysis.

This capstone emphasizes the full data science lifecycle, including:

- Data collection and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature exploration and visualization  
- Identifying patterns, correlations, and trends  
- Deriving **actionable insights** from real-world health-related data
